Hello everyone. I thought we could do a fun little story making project. I'll start off a story and you guys can continue you it.

Jake was a shy boy living in Georgia. He was very anxious to move to a new neighborhood because he heard bad things about it. 
As his family pulled into the driveway, he saw curtains move around for a second through one of the attic windows.
A chill passed through the air, highly unusual for Georgia in July. Jake, being an observant fellow, noted the movement
and the chilly air in his iPad for later reference. He slid the iPad back into the pocket of his brown overcoat, watching
the doors of the sedan swing open from across the lawn. Jake sighed, glad that he wasn't alone in this unfamiliar place.
His father popped out of the car wearing his lucky cowbow hat with the little white dice from their trip to Las Vegas.
Jake smiled remembering all the good memories while he walked up the driveway, shivering from another cool gust of wind. Later that day, when Jake was getting his new room ready for bed, he noticed an odd noise coming from the attic.
