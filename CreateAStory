Hello everyone. I thought we could do a fun little story making project. I'll start off a story and you guys can continue you it.

Jake was a shy boy living in Georgia. He was very anxious to move to a new neighborhood because he heard bad things about it. 
As his family pulled into the driveway, he saw curtains move around for a second through one of the attic windows.
A chill passed through the air, highly unusual for Georgia in July. Jake, being an observant fellow, noted the movement
and the chilly air in his iPad for later reference.
