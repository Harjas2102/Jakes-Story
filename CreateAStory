Hello everyone. I thought we could do a fun little story making project. I'll start off a story and you guys can continue you it.

Jake was a shy boy living in Georgia. He was very anxious to move to a new neighborhood because he heard bad things about it.

the rickety ladder leading down to his room on the second floor of the house..
